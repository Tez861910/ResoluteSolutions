# GitHub Pages Deployment Verification

## Issue Analysis

The error you're seeing:
```
GET https://tez861910.github.io/src/main.jsx net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)
```

This suggests that GitHub Pages is serving the **source** `index.html` file instead of the **built** `dist/index.html` file.

## What Should Happen vs What's Happening

### ✅ **Built Version (Correct)**
The `dist/index.html` contains:
```html
<script type="module" crossorigin src="/ResoluteSolutions/assets/js/index-ByXtLLRe.js"></script>
```

### ❌ **Source Version (Wrong)**
The source `index.html` contains:
```html
<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
```

## Potential Solutions

### 1. **Check Repository Settings**
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/tez861910/ResoluteSolutions`
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, ensure it's set to **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")

### 2. **Check GitHub Actions**
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Verify the latest workflow run completed successfully
3. Check that it's deploying from the `dist` folder

### 3. **Clear GitHub Pages Cache**
Sometimes GitHub Pages caches old deployments:
1. Make a small change to your repository
2. Commit and push to trigger a new deployment
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation

### 4. **Verify Branch Configuration**
If you're still using branch-based deployment:
1. Make sure you're deploying from the `gh-pages` branch
2. Check that the `gh-pages` branch contains the built files, not source files

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Build and deploy manually
npm run build
npm run deploy

# Check what's in the dist folder
ls -la dist/

# Verify the built index.html
cat dist/index.html | grep "script"
```

## Next Steps

1. **First**: Check your repository's Pages settings
2. **Then**: Look at the latest GitHub Actions run
3. **Finally**: Try a manual deployment if GitHub Actions isn't working

Let me know what you find in your repository settings!
