# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites ✅

Before starting, make sure you have:

- [x] React app built with Vite
- [x] GitHub repository created
- [x] Code pushed to GitHub
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow file

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. **Repository Settings Configuration**

This is the most important step:

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/tez861910/ResoluteSolutions`
2. Click on **⚙️ Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **📄 Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - ❌ **NOT** "Deploy from a branch"
   - ✅ **YES** "GitHub Actions"

### 2. **Verify Your Workflow File**

Your `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` should contain:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "18"
          cache: "npm"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: "./dist"

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### 3. **Trigger Deployment**

You can deploy in three ways:

#### **Option A: Automatic (Push to main)**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

#### **Option B: Manual Trigger**

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on **"Deploy to GitHub Pages"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button
4. Click **"Run workflow"** again

#### **Option C: Local Deploy Command**

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### 4. **Monitor the Deployment**

1. Go to **Actions** tab: `https://github.com/tez861910/ResoluteSolutions/actions`
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Watch the build and deploy process
4. Look for green checkmarks ✅

### 5. **Access Your Site**

Once deployed, your site will be available at:
**🔗 https://tez861910.github.io/ResoluteSolutions/**

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues:

#### **Issue: "Missing environment" error**

✅ **Fixed**: Your workflow already has the correct environment configuration

#### **Issue: 404 errors on refresh**

✅ **Fixed**: You have `404.html` and SPA redirect scripts

#### **Issue: Assets not loading**

✅ **Fixed**: Asset filenames have been updated to remove spaces

#### **Issue: Wrong source files served**

**Solution**: Make sure repository Pages settings use "GitHub Actions", not branch deployment

### **Verify Deployment Success:**

1. **Check workflow status**: Should show green ✅
2. **Test the URL**: Visit `https://tez861910.github.io/ResoluteSolutions/`
3. **Check browser console**: Should not show 404 errors for assets
4. **Test navigation**: Click through different pages

## 📱 **Commands Summary**

```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# Deploy manually (alternative method)
npm run deploy

# Check build output
ls -la dist/

# Development server
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 **Expected Timeline**

- **Build**: 2-3 minutes
- **Deploy**: 1-2 minutes
- **Propagation**: 1-5 minutes
- **Total**: ~5-10 minutes

## ✅ **Success Checklist**

- [ ] Repository Settings → Pages → Source = "GitHub Actions"
- [ ] Workflow file exists at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- [ ] Latest commit pushed to main branch
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
- [ ] Site accessible at GitHub Pages URL
- [ ] All assets loading correctly
- [ ] Navigation working properly

## 🆘 **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the **Actions** tab for error messages
2. Verify **Pages** settings are correct
3. Clear browser cache and try again
